# UpStateDynamicsProject
Analysis code used to investigate the role of PV and SST in UpState dynamics 

This is my first ever repository so things may be a bit messy. The analysis code will be divided into two main groups. The first is used for the ovearall analysis of raw data into more organized data. The other type will be the code used to make figures, note that some of the code used for making the figures also has some analysis in it.
